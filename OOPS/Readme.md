## Readme Notes

1. Inheritence
2. Polymorphism
3. Data Abstraction
4. Encapsulation


### Inheritence
```
It specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object

It basically provides re-usability of code
```

### Polymorphism
```
Polymorphism contains two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means many and Morphs means form, shape. By polymorphism, we understand that one task can be performed in different ways. For example You have a class animal, and all animals speak. But they speak differently. Here, the "speak" behavior is polymorphic in the sense and depends on the animal. So, the abstract "animal" concept does not actually "speak", but specific animals (like dogs and cats) have a concrete implementation of the action "speak".
```

### Encapsulation
```
It is used to restrict access to methods and variables. In encapsulation,code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.
```

### Data Abstraction
```
Abstraction is used to hide the internal detail and show only functionalities.
